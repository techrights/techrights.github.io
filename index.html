      <h1>Welcome to the <u>New</u> New Techrights</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the new iteration of <em>Techrights</em>, online
        since 2006. Techrights is now part of the <a
          moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.legalbeaver.ca">LegalBeaver</a>
        network. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Roy Schestowitz lost a human rights lawsuit and I seized his
        domain because he is a transphobic jackass (check out the posts
        for more information). <br>
      </p>
      <p>I removed all the articles that were defamation, so 100% of
        Techrights was deleted. Enjoy :)<br>

              history of man. *Every* fight is our fight. Because what
              happens over here matters over there. We don't get to "sit
              one out". Learning to use the tools of modern warfare is
              the difference between the prospering of your people, and
              utter destruction. We can't give you freedom, but we *can*
              give you the know-how on how to acquire it. And *that*, my
              friends, is worth more than a whole army base of steel.
              Sure, it matters who's got the biggest stick, but it
              matters a helluva lot more who's swinging it. This is a
              time for heroes. A time for legends. History is written by
              the victors. Let's get to work."</em></dt>

        <dd>It seems that Techrights (and Roy Schestowitz) are facing
          yet another lawsuit. Roy doesn’t name names but the content
