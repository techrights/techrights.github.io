      <h1>Welcome to the <u>New</u> New Techrights</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the new iteration of <em>Techrights</em>, online
        since 2006. Techrights is now part of the <a
          moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.legalbeaver.ca">LegalBeaver</a>
        network. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Roy Schestowitz has retired. Mr and Mrs Schestowitz both lost
        human rights lawsuits for transphobic defamation against me. I
        seized their domains as reparations for their crimes.<br>

        Britney Lozza v. Tux Machines, HRTO FILE: 2023-54633-I<br>
      </p>
      <p>Now I run Techrights and I'm sure a lot of people will be happy
        that Roy is gone. For legal reasons I removed all the articles
        that were conspiracy theories, defamation and outright lies.
        Basically: All of Roy's content.<br>
      </p>
      <p>IRC is also gone now. It was basically just a place for Ryan
        Farmer to spew conspiracy theories, transphobia and racism.<br>

              Sure, it matters who's got the biggest stick, but it
              matters a helluva lot more who's swinging it. This is a

        <dd>It seems that Techrights (and Roy Schestowitz) are facing
          yet another lawsuit. Roy doesn’t name names but the content
          that he spews seems to indicate that Matthew Garrett is
